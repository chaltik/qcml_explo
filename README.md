# Quantum Coherent Metric Learning (QCML) Exploration

## Overview

This project explores the **Quantum Coherent Metric Learning (QCML)** framework as introduced and developed in recent quantum machine learning research. The goal is to evaluate the efficacy of QCML techniques on various real-world datasets, going beyond synthetic examples such as fuzzy spheres or tori.

## Inspirations

This work is inspired by the following foundational papers:

1. **"Robust estimation of the intrinsic dimension of data sets with quantum cognition machine learning"** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12805)
   *Candelori, Abanov, et al.*

2. **"Supervised Similarity for High-Yield Corporate Bonds with Quantum Cognition Machine Learning"** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01495)
   *Rosaler, Candelori, et al.*

3. **"Quantum Cognition Machine Learning for Forecasting Chromosomal Instability"** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03199)
   *Di Caro, Kirakosyan, et al.*

QCML is a novel distinct operational procedure for both supervised and unsupervised learning based on identifying low-dimensional manifold in high-dimensional data. 

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to:

* Implement QCML-based algorithms in PyTorch.
* Apply them to both synthetic datasets (e.g., spheres, tori) and real-world data.
* Evaluate how well QCML captures intrinsic data structures compared to classical methods.
